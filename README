This is a javascript powered, basic math application I made for my kiddos to easily practice their basics on without wasting a bunch of paper.

How it works
===========
The user can enter the number of equations they want, the operator (+ or -) and the highest possible number for the equation.  After submitting the form, it creates the equations with an input and answer submit button for each equation.

Features
==============

- Enter the highest # you want in your equations
- Enter the number of equations you want
- Choose between + and - for the operator
- For +, choose to do basic algebra (ie - 5 + _ = 10)
- Green check when the question is right
- Red X with the submitted answer above it when the question is wrong (this way, you can check how many times someone tried the question and what answer they submitted each time)


Roadmap
===============
- Fixed number equations (10 + random #; 10 + random #; 10 + random #; ....)
- Change radio button +, -, *, and / to checkboxes so you can randomly allow a mix of any checked
- Store answers in array instead of outputting it as a class
